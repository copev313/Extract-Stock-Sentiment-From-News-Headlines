# Extract-Stock-Sentiment-From-News-Headlines
We scrape news headlines for FB and TSLA then apply sentiment analysis to generate investment insight.

### Project Description
It used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds. Did you know news articles are automatically being generated from figures and earnings call streams? In this project, we generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Using this natural language processing technique, we get to interpret the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.
